contract Sender {
    receive() external payable {}

    // This is known as a fallback function.
    // It executes when the contract receives Ether through an external transaction (msg.value).
    // Since this function is empty, it simply accepts the incoming Ether without performing any additional operations.

    function withdrawTransfer(address payable _to) public {
        _to.transfer(10);
    }

    // This line sends 10 wei to the _to address using the transfer function.
    // The transfer function automatically reverts the transaction if it fails.

    function withdrawSend(address payable _to) public {
        bool isSent = _to.send(10);

        require(isSent, "Unsuccessful!");
    }
    // This function sends 10 wei using the send function.
    // Unlike transfer, send does not automatically revert if the transaction fails; instead, it returns true or false.
    // The require(isSent, "Unsuccessful!"); statement ensures that if the transfer fails, the transaction is reverted.
}

// ---Key Points:

// -transfer:
// Imposes a 2300 gas limit.
// If the transfer fails, it automatically reverts.

// -send:
// Also imposes a 2300 gas limit.
// If the transfer fails, it only returns false instead of reverting.
// If the recipient contract performs additional operations in its receive or fallback function (e.g., emitting an event), the 2300 gas limit may not be enough, causing the send function to fail.

contract ReceiverNoAction {
    // This contract is a simple contract designed solely to receive Ether.
    function balance() public view returns (uint256) {
        // This function returns the current balance of the contract.
        return address(this).balance;
    }

    receive() external payable {}
    // This function automatically accepts incoming Ether from the Sender contract or any other account.
    // Since it performs no additional operations, it can receive Ether sent via both the transfer and send functions without issues.
}

// ---Key Points
// When Ether is sent to this contract using transfer or send, there are no issues, because the receive function does not execute additional logic.
// The 2300 gas limit imposed by transfer and send is sufficient for the transaction to succeed.

// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

contract ReceiverAction {
    // This contract also accepts Ether but performs an additional operation to record the received amount.
    uint256 public balanceRecived;

    // A variable used to store the amount of received Ether.

    receive() external payable {
        balanceRecived += msg.value;
    }

    // Executes when the contract receives Ether.
    // Uses balanceReceived += msg.value; to record the received amount.
    // Since this modifies storage, it requires additional gas and may exceed the 2300 gas limit imposed by transfer and send.

    function balance() public view returns (uint256) {
        return address(this).balance;
    }
    // Returns the contract's current balance.
}

// Key Points
// If Ether is sent to this contract using Sender.withdrawSend(), the transaction will likely fail because the 2300 gas limit from send may not be enough to update storage (balanceReceived += msg.value;).
// If Sender.withdrawTransfer() is used, it will revert since transfer also enforces the 2300 gas limit.

// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Conclusion
// If you are making a payment to a contract like ReceiverAction, do not use transfer or send. Instead, use the low-level call function:

// (bool success, ) = _to.call{value: 10}("");
// require(success, "Failed to send Ether");

// If you are sending Ether to a contract that only accepts payments (like ReceiverNoAction), you can use transfer or send.
// transfer is safer because it automatically reverts if an error occurs.
// send returns false on failure but does not revert automatically, so if you donâ€™t check the return value, you might not notice the failure.
